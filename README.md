example-ratpack-gradle-groovy-bare
==================================

This is the bare minimum you need to get started with a Groovy and Gradle [Ratpack](https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack) application.

Created as an extremely simple alternative to the existing examples found at these repositories:

* https://github.com/ratpack/example-books
* https://github.com/ratpack/example-ratpack-gradle-groovy-app

I highly recommend checking out the other examples linked above as they will surely be more useful to you. This was just an exercise in finding out the bare minimum code necessary to run a Ratpack app and as such, there are some notable omissions. You won't find any testing here, nor will you find SpringLoaded (which is awesome, by the way).
 
Run the app using `./gradlew run`, `./gradlew.bat run`, or `gradle run`, depending on your OS and whether or not you have Gradle installed. Once it's started, you can navigate to http://localhost:5050 to access the only page in the app.
